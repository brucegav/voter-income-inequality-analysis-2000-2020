# Project Hypothesis & Research Framework

## Central Hypothesis

Growing income inequality in the United States since 2000 has created deep societal resentment against institutions and elites, which has manifested as increased political polarization and support for anti-establishment candidates.

## Theoretical Framework

### Causal Mechanism
Income Inequality → Economic Resentment → Anti-Institutional Sentiment → Political Polarization

### Key Assumptions
1. Economic inequality creates relative deprivation
2. People blame institutions and elites for their economic struggles  
3. This resentment translates into voting behavior
4. Anti-establishment voting reflects broader institutional distrust

## Testable Predictions

1. **Geographic Correlation**: Areas with higher inequality will show greater political volatility
2. **Temporal Correlation**: Increases in inequality will precede increases in anti-establishment voting
3. **Demographic Patterns**: Groups most affected by inequality will show strongest political shifts
4. **Institutional Measures**: Anti-establishment voting will correlate with measures of institutional distrust

## Alternative Explanations

- Cultural/social changes unrelated to economics
- Media fragmentation and polarization
- Partisan sorting along non-economic lines  
- Geographic sorting of like-minded individuals

## Measurement Challenges

- Defining "anti-establishment" candidates/voting
- Measuring institutional resentment quantitatively
- Separating correlation from causation
- Controlling for confounding variables
